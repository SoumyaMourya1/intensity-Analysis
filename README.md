# Intensity Analysis README

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Intensity Analysis** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to predict the emotional intensity of text reviews. The system classifies text as expressing happiness, anger, or sadness, helping businesses optimize processes and improve customer satisfaction.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Gathering text data and their intensity labels.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting key textual features.
- **Model Selection & Training**: Choosing appropriate ML models and training them.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measuring performance using various metrics.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing models for improved accuracy.
- **Deployment Plan**: Steps to integrate the model into a production environment.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NLTK, Seaborn, Matplotlib

You can install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to `intensity_analysis.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.
3. The model will train on provided data and generate predictions.
4. Performance metrics and visualizations will be displayed.

## Output
- Accuracy and classification reports.
- Model evaluation metrics.
- Predictions on sample text data.
